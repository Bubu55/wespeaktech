## Hello and Welcome
So I managed the following things with the tutorial:
* create a repository
* choose a theme
* change the name of the file

And then I encountered this:
1. What is the editor? This is the editor.
2. What is Mark-Down? There is a tutorial. MarkDown is like styling in html jut easier. 
>Real easy. 
>Totally love it.
I do not know how to close the pull quote
3. What does "Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files" mean? Jekyll is a site generator that transforms mark-up language into a website. Jekyll comes with nice themes and many explanations and words I do not understand  - yet. Liquid 

4. I want to add an image. Do I have to upload it to the repository?

>I am happy

Hm, not that useful.

I thought that everything I saw in the theme would be here in code and I just add the content at the right place. Hm. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Bubu55/wespeaktech/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Bubu55/wespeaktech/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

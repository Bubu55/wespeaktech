## Hello and Welcome
So I managed the following things with the tutorial:
* create a repository
* choose a theme
* change the name of the file

And then I encountered this:
1. What is the editor? This is the editor.
2. What is Mark-Down? There is a tutorial. MarkDown is like styling in html jut easier. 
>Real easy. 
>Totally love it.
I want to add a picture, but I do not knwo how to upload one. 
3. What does "Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files" mean? Jekyll is a site generator that transforms mark-up language into a website. Jekyll comes with nice themes and many explanations and words I do not understand  - yet. Liquid 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Bubu55/wespeaktech/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Bubu55/wespeaktech/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
